# A Non-invasive Pulmocarbtor

# Inspiration😎
Whenever we use a lung cancer checking machine(invasive) it always takes blood from our body or another required things which may be very less which also gives pain to us(specially to babies if they are having lung cancer) with delayed time reports and very high cost of checking and detection of lung cancer so we have developed from that inspiration of this, so the person will only has to blow the air from his mouth …and that's it the readings of lung cancer and details will come irrespective of any age the details will come in our android app. ​Also, to reduce the radiation exposure to body while testing this small step will remove even that slightest exposure also. This  is the future of Medicare and healthcare where we will not use a single fluid from body to check which is we are making a non invasive pulmocarbtor. Also, seeing the recent counting from WHO about 3.8 million cases of lung cancer as amongst 1.86 million deaths per year. So, with the concept of our early detection and cheap cost effective device we want to make this world a better place to live in and promote healthy and healthcare lives around the world also solving. Also, almost all of the UN 16 SDG goals are related to health or their achievement will contribute to health indirectly and our device will give and follow also focus (SDG 3): which is  ‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’ and completely matching out the instances.​


# What it does👀
It checks the lung cancer levels just from the blown air of the mouth from benzene level sensing..... We have our solution based on IoT automation and wireless sensor devices with technology of breath involvement for calculation of results on chemical composition. Also with the help of public cloud and app development techniques we sync the reports of the device and user instantly. We also will include AI/Ml into it so that it will be going to learn from the records previously and suggests a better feedback to us.

# How we built it & concept behind it📑🎆🎆
The human breath contains several hundred VOCs with concentrations ranging from part- per-trillion (ppt) to part-per-million (ppm).The human breath contains several hundred VOCs with concentrations ranging from part- per-trillion (ppt) to part-per-million (ppm). The human breath was first analysed by Pauling in 1971 using gas chromatography and around 250 different gases were identified.😲 In our body various biochemical process goes on,our intake food is oxidized gets converted into energy that is required in our body to growth and development. Along with energy various by product also produce in the biochemical reaction. For a healthy person the byproduct are excreted from body in the form of urine ,breath, sweat etc & breath byproduct concentration are same. But in some case of diseases the concentration varies because of the alteration in biochemical process. Similarly in the lung cancer patient, the concentration of benzene is lowas compared to healthy individual. As the result the benzene level in blood cells & breath is increased. So, we can measure that difference level  through benzene present in our breath.

# Android app 👨‍💻
Along with the hardware, we have made an android application where the user can store his/her daily measured data and can have support. The application has its own server maintained using Google Firebase for password authentication and login related data. Each user can create their own account in the application itself and can check his daily, weekly or monthly reports. The user must enter his glucose level as shown from the device in the application. Health support and good practices can also be seen in the app. We also connected Thingspeak IOT to collect the sensors data efficiently and send it to cloud and update in the app We also used many AWS services to make the flow and latency time lesser

**AWS S3** - AUTO UPLOAD IMAGES TO CLOUD.WHEN THE REPORTS OR ANYTHING WILL BE DONE THE RESULTANT IMAGES WILL BE STORED IN S3    
**AWS DYNAMODB** - FOR KEEPING DATABASES AND WHENEVER THE USER WANTS TO SEE THEM CAN ACCESS IT THROUGH THIS..    
**AWS LAMBDA & FARGATE** - FOR SERVERLESS & SOFT & FAST MANAGEMENT SO THAT WE CAN DEPLOY THIS APP & WEBSITE ALL GLOBALLY WITH NO MANAGING TENSIONS WITH MINIMAL LATENCY   
**AWS API** - TO MAINTAIN BEST API SERVICE TO DEVELOPERS AND GIVE OPTION FOR ALL USERS TO USE API SERVICE AND ALSO WITH OUR WEBSITE TO WORK UPON   

# In the advantages of using this idea or product 🤯: 

Low cost and low power device.   
Small in size and thus making it portable.    
Can be used by anyone.    
Can be used multiple times.    
No or less accessories    
Multipurpose device    
User-friendly    
Comes with an android application for glucose monitoring and controlling    
Regular reminders and measures according to the cancer levels    
Few other parameters like body temperature, lungs functionality, health of heart can be determined in parallel.   
Non-contact in nature to avoid any possible corruptions.

# Challenges we ran into🙄
We ran into challenges like data processing data sheets and calculating the reports for user as we are the first ones to built this, so no previous reports were there so those data sheets needed to be calculate properly which we are doing continuously to bring to action also when we were deploying it to aws the dynamodb part of intricating with real time data from app was a bit challenging.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of👍👍🎊🎊🎊
we successfully did a reading on acetone research papers and we realized that, this was a very unique idea which we found out and it may turn out to be a huge startup idea to be built upon with very less amount of cost and harm to people and environment with reduced medical wastage.

# What we learned
we learned many things like the acetone level sensing from mouth and integrating with cloud to deploy it and with using very ordinary things we can solve a huge problem for the world

# What's next for Non-invasive Pulmocarbtor🔜🔜
we are deciding to grow it to a startup if possible and help as many people as possible with this kind of market evaluation... adding more health detection systems other than diabetes adding of ML in the project so it will auto analyze the reports and become and give more accurate results next.

Can be used for diagnosis of lung cancer early detection(with more convinience)
Can be used to control and maintain the cancer level.
Can be used for temperature measurement, lung, functionality, health of heart etc.
Can be used in medical facilities for quick and painless diagnosis
Can be used to contact local/national doctors/specialists
We will be also looking to develop this not only for blood sugar or diabetes but many other diseases like lung cancer, breast cancer, etc.
We will be also looking to use AWS extensively after this to make it good and fast time error efficient reports.
Reduces medical wastage caused by the one time use strips.
